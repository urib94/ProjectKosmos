# Prompt for Pillar Overview: II. The AstroDynamics Engine

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** II. The AstroDynamics Engine

## 1. Pillar Context

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To simulate the physical laws governing celestial mechanics, stellar evolution, and cosmological phenomena.
* **First Principle Applied:** Physical laws are universal but manifest differently at various scales and energies. A modular, multi-scale, and computationally efficient approach to physics is required.
* **Key Modules within this Pillar:**
    1.  `NBodyGravitationalOrchestrator (NGO)`
    2.  `CosmologicalDynamicsUnit (CDU)`
    3.  `StellarEvolutionEngine (SEE)`
    4.  `RelativisticPhenomenaModeler (RPM)`
    5.  `PlanetaryAtmosphericDynamics (PAD)` (Simplified & Parameterized)
    6.  `PhysicsCulling_LOD_System (PCLS)`

## 2. Task: Write Pillar Overview

You are an LLM agent assisting in the design of "Project Odyssey." Based on the information above from the architectural blueprint:

Write a concise overview for **Pillar II: The AstroDynamics Engine**.

**Instructions:**
1.  Clearly state the **Purpose** of this pillar.
2.  Briefly reiterate the core **First Principle Applied** that guides the design of this pillar's modules.
3.  Conclude by mentioning that this pillar achieves its objectives through a suite of specialized modules designed to handle physics at different scales and for different phenomena. (You do not need to list the modules again here).

**Output Format:** A short paragraph (3-5 sentences) summarizing The AstroDynamics Engine pillar.
