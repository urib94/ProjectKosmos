# Prompt for Implementing: PostProcessingStack (PPS)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** III. The QuantumLeap Renderer
**Module:** 8. PostProcessingStack (PPS)

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint (implicitly part of a modern renderer):**

* **Function:** Applies a series of image-based visual effects to the rendered scene before it is displayed to the user. Operates on the fully rendered HDR frame (or intermediate buffers).
* **Effects (Examples):** Bloom, lens flares, anti-aliasing (TAA), depth of field, motion blur, color grading, screen space reflections (SSR). Exposure and Tone Mapping are also key post-processes, handled by Lighting_ExposureEngine (LEE) but executed within this stack.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar III):** The engine must handle extreme dynamic range in scale and brightness. Post-processing enhances realism and visual appeal.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the PostProcessingStack (PPS) module for Project Odyssey. This module manages and applies a sequence of full-screen image processing effects to enhance the final rendered image.

1.  **Effect Pipeline Management:**
    * Implement a flexible pipeline or stack that allows multiple post-processing effects to be chained together in a specific order.
    * Allow enabling/disabling individual effects and reordering them (if meaningful).
2.  **Core Post-Processing Effects:**
    * **Bloom:** Creates a soft glow around bright areas of the scene (e.g., stars, engine glows, bright reflections).
    * **Lens Flares:** Simulates optical artifacts (flares, ghosts) when viewing bright light sources. Can be procedural or texture-based.
    * **Anti-Aliasing (AA):**
        * **Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA):** Essential for reducing jagged edges and temporal shimmering, especially with PBR materials and fine details.
        * Options for other AA methods (FXAA, SMAA) as fallbacks or for different performance tiers.
    * **Depth of Field (DoF):** Simulates camera lens focus, blurring foreground or background objects based on distance from a focal plane.
    * **Motion Blur:** Blurs objects based on their screen-space velocity or camera movement to enhance the sense of speed and motion.
    * **Color Grading:** Allows artistic adjustment of the final image's colors, contrast, saturation, and overall look (e.g., using LUTs - Lookup Tables).
    * **Screen Space Reflections (SSR):** (Optional - can be expensive) Simulates reflections on glossy surfaces by raymarching in screen space.
    * **Vignette:** Darkens the corners of the screen for artistic effect.
    * **Film Grain / Noise:** Adds subtle noise for a cinematic or retro effect.
    * **Chromatic Aberration:** Simulates lens color fringing.
3.  **Integration with Lighting & Exposure Engine (LEE):**
    * **Exposure and Tone Mapping (executed here):** While designed in LEE, the application of auto-exposure adjustments and the final tone mapping pass typically occur as part of the PPS, operating on the HDR scene buffer before conversion to LDR for display.
4.  **Parameterization and Configuration:**
    * Each post-processing effect should have configurable parameters to control its intensity and quality (e.g., bloom threshold/intensity, DoF focal distance/aperture, TAA jitter spread).
    * Allow users to adjust these settings via graphics options menus.
5.  **Render Target Management:**
    * Manage intermediate render targets (textures) required for multi-pass post-processing effects.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust, with extensive shader programming (GLSL/HLSL/WGSL) for each effect.
* **Graphics API:** Vulkan, DirectX 12.
* **Performance Considerations:**
    * Post-processing effects can be GPU-intensive. Each effect adds to the frame time.
    * Optimize shaders and minimize texture bandwidth (e.g., use half-precision float textures where appropriate).
    * Offer quality settings for expensive effects (e.g., TAA sample count, bloom quality).
    * Some effects might be combined into fewer passes/shaders if possible.
* **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    * If a post-processing shader fails to compile or an effect encounters an error, it should be possible to disable that specific effect gracefully without crashing the renderer.
* **Logging:**
    * Log the enabled post-processing effects and their settings at startup or when changed.
    * Log any errors during shader compilation or effect application.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input (operates on):**
    * The fully rendered HDR scene framebuffer from the main rendering passes.
    * G-Buffer data (depth, normals, motion vectors) for effects like TAA, DoF, Motion Blur, SSR.
    * Parameters from Lighting_ExposureEngine (LEE) for exposure and tone mapping.
    * Configuration System & UI: For user-configurable quality settings for each effect.
* **Output:**
    * The final LDR (Low Dynamic Range) image ready for display on the user's screen.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Visual Validation (Primary Method):**
    * Enable each post-processing effect individually and in combination.
    * Carefully inspect the visual output for desired results and absence of artifacts (e.g., TAA ghosting, excessive bloom, incorrect DoF blurring).
    * Test on various scenes (bright, dark, high-contrast, fast motion) to ensure robustness.
* **Parameter Sweeping:**
    * Test the full range of configurable parameters for each effect to ensure they behave as expected and don't cause visual issues at extremes.
* **Performance Profiling:**
    * Measure the GPU cost of each individual post-processing effect and the entire stack.
    * Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize.
    * Test performance impact of different quality settings for each effect.
* **Comparative Tests:**
    * Compare the visual quality of implemented effects (e.g., TAA, Bloom) against established implementations in other engines or academic papers.

## 6. Documentation

* Document each implemented post-processing effect: its purpose, algorithm (briefly), and visual impact.
* List all configurable parameters for each effect and their recommended ranges/defaults.
* Explain the order of operations in the post-processing stack and why it's structured that way.
* Provide guidance on how to achieve different visual styles using combinations of effects and color grading.
* Document performance implications of different effects and quality settings.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Active Observation:** Post-processing effects like DoF, motion blur, and bloom directly influence the user's visual perception of the scene, often mimicking real-world camera or eye behavior.
* **Finite Computation:** Effects must be optimized for real-time performance. Quality settings allow users to balance visual fidelity with computational cost.
* **Aesthetic Fidelity:** While some effects are for realism (TAA, exposure), many (bloom, color grading, vignette) are crucial for achieving the desired artistic style and visual appeal of the simulation.
