# Prompt for Implementing: QuantumLeap Renderer (QLR)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** III. The QuantumLeap Renderer

## 1. Pillar Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To render the universe with scientific and aesthetic fidelity across all scales, from planetary landscapes to intergalactic vistas. Light is the messenger; its behavior is key.
* **First Principle Applied:** The engine must handle extreme dynamic range in scale and brightness, and vast distances. Deferred rendering, aggressive LOD, specialized shaders, and accurate lighting are paramount.

## 2. Core Modules & Implementation Vision

You are to develop the QuantumLeap Renderer (QLR) pillar for Project Odyssey. This pillar is responsible for all visual and auditory rendering, ensuring scientific plausibility, performance, and immersion. Implement the following modules:

### 2.1 SceneGraph_MultiScaleCoordinateSystem (SMCS)
* Implement a hierarchical scene graph for all renderable entities, tightly coupled with the CosmicObjectDatabase (COD).
* Support multi-scale coordinates (camera-relative, scaled contexts, double precision core positions).
* Implement culling (frustum, occlusion, distance-based).

### 2.2 LevelOfDetail_Subsystem (LODS)
* Dynamically select and transition between geometric and textural representations based on distance, screen size, and importance.
* Implement LOD for planets, stars, galaxies, nebulae, etc., as described in the architecture.

### 2.3 PhysicallyBasedShaderLibrary (PBSL)
* Develop PBR materials for all surfaces.
* Implement atmospheric, stellar, accretion disk, jet, gravitational lensing, volumetric, and galaxy shaders.
* Ensure shaders are physically motivated and performant.

### 2.4 Lighting_ExposureEngine (LEE)
* Implement an HDR rendering pipeline.
* Support multiple light sources, realistic falloff, color temperature, and dynamic exposure.
* Implement advanced tone mapping, shadowing, and light travel time effects.

### 2.5 ProceduralContentGeneration_Rendering (PCG_R)
* GPU-accelerated procedural terrain generation for landable planets/moons.
* Implement texture synthesis, VFX, and volumetric effects as described.

### 2.6 CosmicBackgroundRenderer (CBR)
* Render the distant universe as a dynamic skybox/skysphere.
* Use real star catalog data and procedural generation for distant objects.
* Optionally visualize the CMB.

### 2.7 AudioEngine (AE)
* Provide immersive auditory experience, including procedural and sampled audio, physics-driven sounds, ambient soundscapes, and data sonification.
* Implement 3D positional audio and effects processing.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust (Adhere to overall project choice).
* **Graphics API:** Vulkan preferred, with support for HDR, advanced shaders, and multi-scale rendering.
* **Data Structures:** Scene graphs, LOD trees, shader/material libraries.
* **Performance:** Aggressive culling, LOD, and GPU acceleration.
* **Configuration:** Allow for tuning of rendering and audio parameters.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input:**
    * Data from COD, physics modules, and procedural generators.
* **Output:**
    * Visual and auditory output to the user.
    * Feedback to simulation modules for LOD and asset streaming.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test scene graph traversal, LOD selection, shader correctness, and audio playback.
* **Performance Tests:**
    * Benchmark rendering and audio pipelines under various loads.
* **Visual/Audio Inspection:**
    * Qualitatively assess scientific plausibility and immersion.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the rendering and audio pipeline, including all major modules and algorithms.
* Specify the format and structure of scene, LOD, and shader data.
* Provide guidance for tuning performance and extending functionality.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Scientific Grounding:** All rendering and audio should be physically motivated and plausible.
* **Performance:** Optimized for real-time, multi-scale simulation.
* **Modularity:** Provide a clean, well-documented API for integration with other modules.
