**Context:** You are an LLM agent assisting in the design of "Project Odyssey." This prompt concerns the core philosophy underpinning the project's development. The project vision emphasizes scientific accuracy, real-time interaction, vast exploration, and an educational AI tutor.

**Task:** Define the **Core Philosophy** for Project Odyssey.

**Instructions for Definition:**
1.  State the overarching philosophical approach to designing and building the simulation.
2.  Emphasize the importance of designing from **"first principles."** Briefly explain what this means in the context of simulating a universe (i.e., building from fundamental truths of the universe and computational science, rather than just copying existing solutions without critical evaluation).
3.  List the key pillars that this philosophy will uphold (e.g., scalability, modularity, performance, scientific grounding, user engagement).
4.  The philosophy should guide all subsequent architectural and development decisions.

**Output Format:** A clear and concise statement of the Core Philosophy.
