**Context:** You are an LLM agent assisting in the design of "Project Odyssey," an immersive universe simulation. The project's vision is to allow vast exploration with scientific accuracy and AI-guided learning. The core philosophy is to design from first principles, upholding scalability, modularity, performance, scientific grounding, and user engagement.

**Task:** List and briefly elaborate on the fundamental **Guiding Principles** derived from the Core Philosophy that will direct the architecture of Project Odyssey. There are seven such principles.

**Instructions for Elaboration (for each of the seven principles):**
* **Principle 1: Hierarchical & Scalable Universe:** Explain the need to manage extreme dynamic range in scale.
* **Principle 2: Gravity-Dominated Structure:** Mention the roles of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity (GR).
* **Principle 3: Finite Speed of Light:** Explain its impact on observation and as a universal limit.
* **Principle 4: Evolving Matter & Energy:** Describe the need for a dynamic simulation (stars evolve, universe expands).
* **Principle 5: Active Observation:** Explain how the user's perspective shapes their experience.
* **Principle 6: Finite Computation:** Emphasize the necessity of abstraction, Level of Detail (LOD), procedural generation, and targeted calculations.
* **Principle 7: Contextual & Interactive Learning:** Describe how information should be presented and how users should be able to interact for learning.

**Output Format:** A numbered list of the seven Guiding Principles, each with a brief (1-2 sentence) elaboration.
