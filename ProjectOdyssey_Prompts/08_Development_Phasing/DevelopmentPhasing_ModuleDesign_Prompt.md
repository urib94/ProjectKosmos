# Prompt for Implementing: Development Phasing

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** VIII. Development Phasing

## 1. Pillar Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To guide the project through a phased, iterative development approach, focusing on building a stable core and incrementally adding features and complexity.
* **First Principle Applied:** Large, complex systems are best built in well-defined, manageable phases, with each phase delivering a functional, testable product.

## 2. Phased Development Approach & Implementation Vision

You are to implement the Development Phasing strategy for Project Odyssey. This pillar is responsible for planning, executing, and integrating all project phases. Address the following phases:

### 2.1 Phase 0: Core Foundation ("The Spark")
* **Goal:** Minimal viable product demonstrating core rendering and interaction in a single, procedurally generated star system.
* **Key Systems:**
    * Continuum Core (window, input, rendering loop)
    * Minimal Cosmic Fabric Engine (UGS, basic COD, procedural generation for one star & planet)
    * Minimal AstroDynamics Engine (simple Keplerian or N-body for one planet)
    * Basic QuantumLeap Renderer (PBR shaders, basic star/planet models, camera)
    * Basic Explorer's Interface (camera control)
* **Integration:** Ensure all core systems communicate and function together.

### 2.2 Phase 1: Scaling & Visual Fidelity ("Local Group")
* **Goal:** Expand to multiple star systems within a small region. Implement robust multi-scale coordinate systems and initial LOD.
* **Key Systems:**
    * Enhanced Cosmic Fabric Engine (multiple systems)
    * Full SMCS and basic LODS in QuantumLeap Renderer
    * Improved shaders, basic interstellar travel
* **Integration:** Test multi-system navigation and rendering.

### 2.3 Phase 2: Physics Depth & Planetary Detail ("Living Worlds")
* **Goal:** Introduce more complex physics and detailed planetary environments.
* **Key Systems:**
    * Advanced N-body in AstroDynamics Engine
    * Basic stellar evolution
    * Initial procedural terrain for landable planets
    * Ring systems, basic moons
    * Refined PhysicsCulling_LOD_System
* **Integration:** Validate physics and terrain generation.

### 2.4 Phase 3: Universe Expansion & Initial AI ("Cosmic Consciousness")
* **Goal:** Generate a full galaxy, introduce intergalactic travel and basic AI interaction.
* **Key Systems:**
    * Full galactic and initial cosmological generation
    * FTL travel
    * Oracle AI integration for contextual information
* **Integration:** Ensure seamless galaxy-scale navigation and AI responses.

### 2.5 Phase 4: Advanced Phenomena & Immersive Learning ("Wonders of the Cosmos")
* **Goal:** Simulate advanced astrophysical phenomena and create a rich, immersive learning experience.
* **Key Systems:**
    * Black holes, neutron stars, nebulae, accretion disks, relativistic effects
    * Fully developed DynamicEncyclopedia_TutorialSystem
    * Enhanced audio-visual immersion, refined UI/UX
* **Integration:** Test advanced rendering, physics, and AI learning modules.

### 2.6 Ongoing: Post-Launch Evolution ("Eternal Expansion")
* **Goal:** Continuous optimization, content updates, community features, and plugin development.
* **Key Systems:**
    * Performance optimization, bug fixing
    * Regular content and model updates
    * Community and plugin features
    * LLM prompt and interaction refinement
* **Integration:** Maintain stability and extensibility.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Testing:** Integrate unit, integration, and system-level tests at each phase.
* **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation and changelogs for each phase.
* **Feedback:** Incorporate user and team feedback into planning and iteration.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input:**
    * Requirements and feedback from all pillars and stakeholders.
* **Output:**
    * Phase plans, integration tests, and release notes.
    * Updated project roadmap and documentation.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Milestone Tests:**
    * Define and execute milestone tests for each phase.
* **Regression Tests:**
    * Ensure new features do not break existing functionality.
* **User Testing:**
    * Gather feedback from users and stakeholders at each phase.

## 6. Documentation

* Document all phases, goals, key systems, and integration strategies.
* Maintain a living roadmap and changelog.
* Provide guidance for onboarding new contributors at each phase.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles
