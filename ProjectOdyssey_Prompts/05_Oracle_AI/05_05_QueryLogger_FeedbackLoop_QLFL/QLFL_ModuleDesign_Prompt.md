# Prompt for Implementing: QueryLogger_FeedbackLoop (QLFL)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** V. The Oracle AI
**Module:** 5. QueryLogger_FeedbackLoop (QLFL) (Optional, with user consent)

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To log anonymized user queries and LLM responses (with user consent) to analyze common questions, prompt effectiveness, response quality, and potentially support future LLM fine-tuning.
* **Functionality:**
    * Logs anonymized user queries and the corresponding LLM responses (ensuring user privacy).
    * This data can be used to:
        * Identify common questions or areas where users seek more information.
        * Analyze the effectiveness of prompt engineering strategies and refine the CPC.
        * Detect biases or inaccuracies in LLM responses for specific topics.
        * (Very Advanced) Provide data for fine-tuning a custom, domain-specific LLM in the future.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar V):** Learning should be integrated, contextual, and driven by curiosity. The LLM should leverage simulation data for relevance and accuracy. (Implicitly, by aiming to improve the learning experience over time).

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the QueryLogger_FeedbackLoop (QLFL) module for Project Odyssey. This module is intended for long-term improvement of the Oracle AI, strictly adhering to user privacy.

1.  **User Consent Mechanism:**
    * Implement a clear and explicit user consent mechanism before any logging is enabled.
    * Users must be able to opt-in or opt-out at any time.
    * Clearly explain what data will be logged and how it will be used.
2.  **Data Anonymization:**
    * Ensure that any logged data is anonymized and does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).
    * Strip or hash any user-specific identifiers from queries or context if they are inadvertently captured.
3.  **Query and Response Logging:**
    * If consent is given, log user queries, the prompts generated by ContextualPromptConstructor (CPC), and the corresponding LLM responses.
    * Log relevant metadata, such as timestamps, LLM provider used, and potentially anonymized session identifiers.
4.  **Secure Data Storage:**
    * Store logged data securely, either locally or on a designated server, with appropriate access controls.
5.  **Data Analysis (Offline):**
    * The primary purpose of this module is to collect data. Analysis would typically be done offline by developers/researchers.
    * Potential analyses: identify frequently asked questions, assess prompt effectiveness, categorize types of queries, detect common LLM errors or hallucinations.
6.  **Feedback Mechanism (Optional):**
    * Consider a simple in-simulation mechanism for users to voluntarily provide feedback on LLM responses (e.g., thumbs up/down, brief comments).

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust (Adhere to overall project choice).
* **Data Format for Logs:** JSON, CSV, or a structured log format.
* **Storage:** Local files, or a secure remote database if data is to be aggregated.
* **Privacy:** Adhere to privacy best practices and relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR if applicable).

## 4. Integration Points

* **Receives Data From:**
    * ContextualPromptConstructor (CPC): To log generated prompts.
    * LLM_Gateway_APIManager (LGAM): To log LLM responses.
    * KnowledgePresenter (KP) or UserInterface_Engine (UIE): To get user queries and potentially feedback.
* **Depends On:**
    * Configuration_ScalabilityManager (CSM): For user consent status.
    * Diagnostic_ProfilingSuite (DPS): For its own operational logging (not user query logging).
* **Output:** Log files or data sent to a secure analytics backend.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Verify consent mechanism logic (opt-in/opt-out).
    * Test anonymization routines.
    * Test logging of queries and responses to various sinks (mocked).
* **Privacy Review:**
    * Conduct a thorough review of the data logging and anonymization process to ensure user privacy is protected.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Ensure that logging is correctly triggered (or not) based on user consent.
    * Verify the integrity and format of logged data.

## 6. Documentation

* Detailed explanation of the data logging process, including what is logged, how it's anonymized, and how it's stored.
* Clear information for users regarding data privacy and consent.
* Guidelines for developers on how to analyze the collected data.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Ethical AI:** Prioritizes user privacy and transparency.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Aims to improve the Oracle AI over time based on real usage data.
* **Modularity:** Logging is a distinct, optional component.
* **User Control:** Users have explicit control over whether their data is logged.
