# Prompt for Implementing: Warp_HyperspaceNavigation (WHN)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** IV. The Explorer's Interface
**Module:** 4. `Warp_HyperspaceNavigation (WHN)`

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Mechanics:** Implements one or more scientifically-plausible (or well-established sci-fi trope) FTL travel mechanics (e.g., "Warp Drive," "Hyperspace Jump," "Alcubierre Drive visualization"). These are primarily for player convenience to traverse vast distances in reasonable *player* time.
* **Parameters:** Requires energy, potential charge-up time, generates unique visual/auditory effects.
* **Calculations:** Calculates travel time (player-perceived vs. universe-simulated if different), energy requirements. Interacts with `CosmologicalExpansionModule (CDU)` for very long-distance jump calculations.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar IV):** Exploration of the vast universe requires intuitive controls. WHN provides the means for timely interstellar and intergalactic travel.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the `Warp_HyperspaceNavigation (WHN)` module for Project Odyssey. This module enables player-controlled spacecraft to travel faster-than-light (FTL) for game progression and exploration convenience, using one or more defined FTL mechanics.

1.  **FTL Mechanic Selection & Design:**
    * Choose and design at least one FTL travel mechanism. Options:
        * **Warp Drive (Alcubierre-like):** Ship creates a local distortion of spacetime. Visually represented by distorted views, specific entry/exit effects. Constant high speed in "warp".
        * **Hyperspace Jump / Jump Drive:** Instantaneous or very rapid travel between two points after a "charge-up" or calculation phase. May involve a separate "hyperspace" dimension visually.
        * **Stargate/Wormhole Network:** Travel through pre-defined (or procedurally placed) stable wormholes or gates connecting distant systems. (This implies specific discoverable infrastructure).
    * The chosen mechanic(s) should have distinct visual and auditory signatures.
2.  **FTL Activation & Targeting:**
    * Integrate with `ObjectInteraction_TargetingSystem (OITS)` to select FTL destinations (stars, known planets, waypoints, coordinates).
    * Implement UI elements (via `UserInterface_Engine - UIE`) for initiating FTL travel, displaying target information, and estimated travel time/energy cost.
3.  **FTL Travel Parameters & Constraints:**
    * **Energy/Fuel Consumption:** FTL travel should consume a significant amount of a dedicated fuel type or ship energy. Consumption may depend on distance, ship mass, or FTL drive efficiency.
    * **Charge-Up / Calculation Time:** Some FTL mechanics may require a preparation phase before travel commences.
    * **Cooldown Time:** A period after FTL travel before another FTL jump can be initiated.
    * **Safety Interlocks/Restrictions:**
        * Prevent FTL activation too close to large gravity wells (stars, planets, black holes) - "gravity shadow."
        * Prevent FTL jumps into or through celestial bodies.
        * Mass limit considerations (e.g., can't warp an entire space station easily).
4.  **Travel Calculation & Execution:**
    * **Path Calculation:** For jump drives, calculate a direct path. For warp drives, it's continuous travel.
    * **Travel Time:**
        * Player-perceived travel time should be manageable for gameplay.
        * Simulation time (`t_sim`) elapsed during FTL might be different (e.g., for very long jumps, `t_sim` could advance significantly, affecting stellar evolution, etc., or it could be a fixed small `t_sim` advancement for gameplay simplicity). This interaction with `TemporalIndexer (TI)` needs clear definition.
    * **Cosmological Expansion:** For intergalactic FTL travel, consult `CosmologicalDynamicsUnit (CDU)` to account for the expansion of the universe when calculating target coordinates and travel parameters.
    * **FTL State Management:** Track the ship's state (e.g., `CHARGING`, `IN_WARP/JUMP`, `COOLDOWN`).
5.  **Visual & Auditory Effects:**
    * Interface with `QuantumLeap Renderer` and `AudioEngine (AE)` to trigger specific visual (e.g., stretching stars, tunnel effect, hyperspace visuals) and audio effects associated with FTL activation, travel, and exit.
6.  **FTL Interruption/Interdiction (Optional - Advanced):**
    * Possibility of FTL travel being interrupted by specific phenomena (e.g., strong, unpredicted gravity fields, fictional interdiction technology). This adds risk/unpredictability.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust.
* **Mathematical Libraries:** For path calculations, coordinate transformations.
* **Performance Considerations:**
    * FTL calculations (pathing, energy, time) should be quick.
    * State management should be efficient.
* **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    * Handle invalid FTL targets (e.g., target too close, inside a star).
    * Manage insufficient fuel/energy for FTL activation.
    * Gracefully handle FTL interruptions if implemented.
* **Logging:**
    * Log FTL activation, target selection, entry/exit from FTL state.
    * Log calculated travel times and energy consumption.
    * Log any FTL errors or interruptions.
* **Configuration:**
    * FTL drive speeds/ranges, energy costs, charge/cooldown times, safety interlock parameters should be configurable per ship type or FTL drive module.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input (receives data from/is controlled by):**
    * `Input_ControlMapper (ICM)`: For player commands to initiate FTL targeting and activation.
    * `ObjectInteraction_TargetingSystem (OITS)`: For selected FTL destination.
    * `UserInterface_Engine (UIE)`: Displays FTL interface, target info, status.
    * `Player_VehicleKinematics (PVK)`: For current ship state (position, velocity, energy/fuel levels, mass).
    * `CosmologicalDynamicsUnit (CDU)`: For accounting for cosmic expansion in intergalactic travel.
    * `TemporalIndexer (TI)`: To determine `t_sim` advancement during FTL.
    * `CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)`: For target object positions and gravity well information (for safety interlocks).
* **Output (provides data/services to):**
    * `Player_VehicleKinematics (PVK)`: Updates ship position instantaneously (for jumps) or manages its high-speed state (for warp). Consumes fuel/energy.
    * `QuantumLeap Renderer` & `AudioEngine (AE)`: Triggers for FTL visual and audio effects.
    * `UserInterface_Engine (UIE)`: Updates FTL status, progress, estimated arrival.
    * `TemporalIndexer (TI)`: May be notified of significant `t_sim` advancement if applicable.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test FTL parameter calculations (energy cost, travel time, charge time) for various distances and ship configurations.
    * Test safety interlock logic (e.g., gravity shadow checks, collision path checks).
* **Functional Tests:**
    * Perform FTL jumps/warps between various points (intra-system, interstellar, intergalactic). Verify:
        * Correct destination arrival.
        * Plausible travel times (player-perceived).
        * Correct fuel/energy consumption.
        * Visual and audio effects trigger correctly.
        * Safety interlocks function as expected.
* **Scenario Tests:**
    * Test FTL travel in edge cases (e.g., very short jumps, extremely long intergalactic jumps).
    * Test FTL interruptions if implemented.
* **Usability Testing:**
    * Ensure the FTL targeting and activation process is intuitive and provides clear feedback to the player.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the chosen FTL mechanic(s) in detail, including their in-universe pseudo-scientific basis or gameplay rationale.
* Detail all parameters, constraints, and calculations involved in FTL travel.
* Explain the safety interlock systems.
* Provide comprehensive documentation for WHN's API and its interactions with other modules.
* Document how visual/audio effects for FTL are triggered and managed.
* Explain how `t_sim` is handled during FTL travel.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Hierarchical & Scalable Universe:** WHN is essential for making the vast scales of the universe practically explorable by the player.
* **Finite Computation & Active Observation:** FTL is a gameplay mechanic that abstracts extreme travel time, keeping the player actively engaged rather than waiting for prohibitive real-time durations.
* **Modularity:** WHN handles the specific logic for FTL travel, distinct from conventional sub-light travel managed by PVK.
