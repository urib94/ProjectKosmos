# Prompt for Implementing: ObjectInteraction_TargetingSystem (OITS)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** IV. The Explorer's Interface
**Module:** 6. `ObjectInteraction_TargetingSystem (OITS)`

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Selection:** Allows user to easily select celestial objects (planets, stars, galaxies, ships, points of interest) using mouse-click, reticle targeting, or list selection from map/HUD.
* **Highlighting:** Visual feedback for selected/targeted objects.
* **Context Menus:** Provides contextual options for selected objects (e.g., "Show Information," "Set as Autopilot Target," "Orbit Object," "Initiate Scan," "Land Here" if applicable).
* **Scanning Mechanics:** "Scanner" tool/mode to reveal properties of unknown or partially known objects.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar IV):** Exploration requires intuitive controls. OITS is key for identifying, learning about, and interacting with the contents of the universe.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the `ObjectInteraction_TargetingSystem (OITS)` module for Project Odyssey. This module enables the player to select, target, and interact with various objects and points of interest within the simulation.

1.  **Object Selection Methods:**
    * **Reticle/Crosshair Targeting:** Select object currently under the screen center reticle/crosshair (if applicable for current view/mode).
    * **Mouse Cursor Selection:** Click on visible objects in the scene to select them. Requires raycasting from camera through cursor position.
    * **List-Based Selection:** Select objects from lists presented in the UI (e.g., system map, navigation targets, scan results).
    * **Cycle Targeting:** Ability to cycle through nearby or relevant targets (e.g., next/previous hostile if combat exists, next/previous scientific POI).
2.  **Target State Management:**
    * Maintain the concept of a "current target" or "selected object."
    * Potentially support a "soft target" (hovered over) vs. "hard target" (locked).
    * Broadcast target change events to other interested modules.
3.  **Visual Feedback for Targeting:**
    * **Highlighting:** Apply visual effects to the selected/targeted object (e.g., outline, bracket, color tint) via the renderer.
    * **HUD Indicators:** Display information about the current target on the Heads-Up Display (name, type, distance, relative velocity).
4.  **Contextual Interaction Menu:**
    * When an object is targeted/selected, provide a contextual menu with available interactions. Examples:
        * `View Information` (opens info panel from `UserInterface_Engine` / `Oracle AI`).
        * `Set as Navigation Target` (for `Warp_HyperspaceNavigation` or sub-light autopilot).
        * `Initiate Orbit` (command for `UnifiedCamera_ViewController` and/or autopilot).
        * `Scan Object` (triggers scanning mechanic).
        * `Land Here` (if on a landable planet/moon, triggers landing sequence).
        * `Dock with Station/Ship`.
        * `Hail Object` (if communication is a feature).
    * Available interactions should depend on the type of target and player's capabilities/distance.
5.  **Scanning Mechanics (Information Discovery):**
    * Implement a "scanning" process for targeted objects.
    * Scanning takes time (scaled by distance, object complexity, scanner capability).
    * Successful scan reveals more detailed information about the object (from `CosmicObjectDatabase`, potentially unlocking data tiers).
    * Visual/audio feedback during scanning and upon completion.
    * Scanner could have different modes (e.g., surface composition, atmospheric analysis, lifeform detection - simplified).
6.  **Point of Interest (POI) System:**
    * Allow defining and targeting generic POIs in space (e.g., a specific coordinate, a mission objective marker, a procedurally generated anomaly).
    * POIs can also be selected and interacted with.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust.
* **Algorithms:**
    * Raycasting (CPU or GPU-based) for mouse selection and reticle targeting.
    * Efficient spatial queries to find nearby objects for cycle targeting (interfacing with `CosmicObjectDatabase`).
* **Performance Considerations:**
    * Raycasting and target updating should be efficient, especially if performed frequently.
    * Highlighting effects should be performant.
* **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    * Handle cases where a target becomes invalid (e.g., destroyed, moves out of range).
    * Gracefully manage failed scan attempts.
* **Logging:**
    * Log target selection changes.
    * Log initiation and completion of scans, and information revealed.
    * Log interaction commands invoked on targets.
* **Configuration:**
    * Scanner range, scan times, targeting reticle appearance.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input (receives data from/is controlled by):**
    * `Input_ControlMapper (ICM)`: For player commands to select, target, cycle targets, initiate scan, open context menu.
    * `UnifiedCamera_ViewController (UCVC)`: For camera position and view direction for raycasting.
    * `UserInterface_Engine (UIE)`: For displaying target lists, context menus, scan progress, and receiving selections from UI elements.
    * `CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)`: To perform spatial queries for targetable objects and retrieve object data once targeted/scanned.
* **Output (provides data/services to):**
    * `UserInterface_Engine (UIE)`: Provides current target information for HUD display, info panels. Triggers display of context menus.
    * `UnifiedCamera_ViewController (UCVC)`: Can set the camera's focus or orbital target.
    * `Warp_HyperspaceNavigation (WHN)` & `Player_VehicleKinematics (PVK Autopilot)`: Provides the navigation destination.
    * `Oracle AI`: Provides the context of the currently selected/scanned object for user queries.
    * `AudioEngine (AE)`: Triggers for targeting sounds, scan sounds, interaction confirmations.
    * Potentially other systems that need to act upon a targeted object (e.g., weapon systems if combat is implemented).

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test raycasting logic against known scene geometry.
    * Test target selection logic (reticle, mouse click, cycling).
    * Test scanning progress and information reveal mechanics.
* **Functional Tests:**
    * Select various object types (planets, stars, ships, POIs) using all available methods.
    * Verify correct visual feedback (highlighting, HUD info).
    * Test all options in contextual interaction menus for different object types.
    * Perform scans on different objects and check if appropriate information is revealed.
* **Usability Testing:**
    * Ensure targeting and selection are intuitive and easy to use across different scales.
    * Check clarity of HUD information and context menus.
    * Evaluate if scanning mechanic feels rewarding and not tedious.
* **Edge Case Testing:**
    * Target objects at extreme distances.
    * Target fast-moving objects.
    * Attempt to interact with objects that should not be interactive.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the different object selection methods and their implementation.
* Explain the target state management (soft/hard targets).
* Detail the scanning mechanic (duration, information tiers, feedback).
* Provide comprehensive documentation for OITS's API, including how other systems subscribe to target changes or query current target info.
* List all available contextual interactions and the conditions under which they appear.
* Document parameters for configuring targeting visuals, scan times, etc.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Active Observation & Interaction:** OITS is central to how the player identifies, learns about, and decides to interact with objects in the universe.
* **Hierarchical & Scalable Universe:** Must be able to target objects from nearby asteroids to distant galaxies, with appropriate feedback and interaction options for each scale.
* **Contextual & Interactive Learning:** Scanning and viewing information about targeted objects are core learning loops.
* **Modularity:** OITS provides a focused service for targeting and interaction, which many other systems consume.
