# Prompt for Implementing: Explorer's Interface (EI)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** IV. The Explorer's Interface

## 1. Pillar Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To provide intuitive and powerful tools for the user to explore, interact with, and control their experience within the simulation.
* **First Principle Applied:** Navigation should be intuitive across vast scales, from walking on a planet to traversing intergalactic space. Both manual and automated travel should be supported.

## 2. Core Modules & Implementation Vision

You are to develop the Explorer's Interface (EI) pillar for Project Odyssey. This pillar is responsible for all user interaction, navigation, and control. Implement the following modules:

### 2.1 UnifiedCamera_ViewController (UCVC)
* Implement seamless camera modes (first-person, third-person, orbital, cinematic).
* Support logarithmic zoom, movement scaling, collision detection, and dynamic FOV.

### 2.2 Input_ControlMapper (ICM)
* Abstract input from various devices (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, HOTAS, VR controllers).
* Support context-sensitive control schemes and user remapping.

### 2.3 Player_VehicleKinematics (PVK)
* Implement player avatar and spacecraft movement physics.
* Support Newtonian flight, thruster mechanics, and flight assists.

### 2.4 Warp_HyperspaceNavigation (WHN)
* Implement FTL travel mechanics (warp, jump, stargate/wormhole).
* Calculate travel times, energy requirements, and visual/audio effects.

### 2.5 TimeDilation_Control (TDC)
* Allow user to accelerate, decelerate, or pause simulation time.
* Provide clear UI indicators and enforce simulation limits.

### 2.6 ObjectInteraction_TargetingSystem (OITS)
* Implement object selection, highlighting, context menus, and scanning mechanics.

### 2.7 UserInterface_Engine (UIE)
* Develop HUD, starmaps, menus, panels, and information displays.
* Ensure clean, informative, and scalable UI design.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust (Adhere to overall project choice).
* **UI Framework:** Use a modern, cross-platform UI toolkit or custom engine UI.
* **Data Structures:** Camera state, input mappings, vehicle/character state, UI layouts.
* **Performance:** Optimize for responsiveness and low latency.
* **Configuration:** Allow for user customization and accessibility options.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input:**
    * User input devices, simulation state, and object data.
* **Output:**
    * User commands, camera state, and UI feedback.
    * Feedback to simulation modules for navigation and control.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test camera transitions, input mapping, vehicle physics, and UI rendering.
* **Usability Tests:**
    * Assess intuitiveness, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Ensure compatibility with simulation and rendering modules.

## 6. Documentation

* Document all interface modules, user controls, and customization options.
* Specify the format and structure of input, camera, and UI data.
* Provide guidance for extending and localizing the interface.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **User-Centric Design:** Prioritize intuitive, accessible, and powerful controls.
* **Performance:** Optimize for real-time interaction.
* **Modularity:** Provide a clean, well-documented API for integration with other modules.
