# Prompt for Implementing: Configuration_ScalabilityManager (CSM)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** VI. The Continuum Core
**Module:** 4. Configuration_ScalabilityManager (CSM)

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To allow users to adjust a wide range of settings to match their hardware capabilities and preferences, and to manage loading/saving of these configurations.
* **User Settings:** Allows users to adjust a wide range of settings: Graphics (Resolution, texture quality, shadow quality, anti-aliasing, draw distance, volumetric effects quality), Physics (Update rate, simulation fidelity for distant objects), Simulation Detail (Particle counts, density of procedural objects).
* **Hardware Detection:** Optionally auto-detects hardware capabilities on first run to suggest appropriate default settings.
* **Configuration Files:** Manages loading and saving of user settings and system configurations in human-readable (e.g., INI, JSON, XML) or binary formats.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar VI):** Robustness, performance, and maintainability are paramount for a project of this complexity. Systems must be designed for efficiency and scalability from the outset.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the Configuration_ScalabilityManager (CSM) module for Project Odyssey. This module allows the simulation to adapt to diverse hardware and user preferences.

1.  **Configuration Data Management:**
    * Define a system for registering, storing, and retrieving configuration variables of various types (int, float, bool, string, enums).
    * Support hierarchical configuration settings (e.g., graphics.resolution.width).
    * Provide mechanisms for setting default values for all settings.
2.  **Loading and Saving Configurations:**
    * Implement loading and saving of configurations from/to files (e.g., INI, JSON, XML, or a custom binary format for efficiency/obfuscation if needed).
    * Support multiple configuration profiles (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Ultra, Custom).
3.  **User Interface Integration:**
    * Provide an API for UI elements to discover, display, and modify configuration settings.
    * Handle validation of user inputs for settings (e.g., min/max values, allowed options).
4.  **Hardware Detection:**
    * Implement basic hardware detection (CPU, GPU, RAM) on first run or on demand.
    * Provide logic to suggest initial quality preset based on detected hardware.
5.  **Scalability Profiles:**
    * Allow different modules to query settings and adjust their behavior accordingly (e.g., renderer adjusting detail, physics engine changing update rates for distant objects).
    * Support runtime changes to settings where feasible, and specify which settings require a restart.
6.  **Command-Line Overrides:**
    * (Optional) Allow certain configuration settings to be overridden via command-line arguments for testing or advanced usage.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust (Adhere to overall project choice).
* **Configuration File Parsers:** Libraries for JSON (e.g., RapidJSON, nlohmann/json for C++), XML (e.g., pugixml, TinyXML2), or INI.
* **Data Structures:** Hash maps or trees for storing configuration variables.
* **Hardware Detection Libraries (Optional):** Platform-specific APIs or cross-platform libraries if available (e.g., querying system information).

## 4. Integration Points

* **Consumed By:** Virtually all other modules in the simulation to tailor their behavior based on settings. Examples:
    * QuantumLeap Renderer: Graphics quality, resolution, feature toggles.
    * AstroDynamics Engine: Physics fidelity, update rates.
    * AssetManagement_StreamingPipeline: Texture quality choices affecting streaming.
    * UserInterface_Engine: To build settings menus.
* **Interacts With:** UserInterface_Engine (UIE) for presenting settings to the user.
* **Depends On:** ModularArchitecture_APILayer (MAAL) for API definitions.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Verify correct loading and saving of configuration files in various formats.
    * Test registration, retrieval, and modification of settings.
    * Test default value application and validation rules.
    * Test hardware detection logic (mocking hardware info if necessary).
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Ensure that changes to settings correctly affect the behavior of relevant modules (e.g., changing resolution updates the renderer).
    * Test profile switching and application.
* **UI Tests:**
    * Verify that settings menus correctly reflect and update CSM values.

## 6. Documentation

* List of all configurable settings, their types, default values, and effects.
* Documentation on the configuration file format and structure.
* API documentation for modules to access and register settings.
* Guide for users on how to customize settings.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Performance:** Allows tuning the simulation to run optimally on different hardware.
* **Scalability:** Enables the simulation to scale its demands based on user hardware and preferences.
* **User Engagement:** Provides users control over their experience.
* **Robustness:** Handles invalid or corrupted configuration files gracefully (e.g., by falling back to defaults).
