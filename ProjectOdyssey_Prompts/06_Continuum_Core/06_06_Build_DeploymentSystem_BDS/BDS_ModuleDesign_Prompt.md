# Prompt for Implementing: Build_DeploymentSystem (BDS)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** VI. The Continuum Core
**Module:** 6. Build_DeploymentSystem (BDS)

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Purpose:** To automate the build process across different target platforms, manage version control integration, package the application, and potentially set up CI/CD pipelines.
* **Automated Builds:** Scripts and tools for automating the build process across different target platforms (Windows, Linux, potentially macOS).
* **Version Control Integration:** Seamless integration with Git for source code management, branching, and tagging releases.
* **Packaging & Distribution:** Tools for packaging the application into distributable installers or archives.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** (Advanced) Setup CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and potentially deploying development/beta versions.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar VI):** Robustness, performance, and maintainability are paramount for a project of this complexity. Systems must be designed for efficiency and scalability from the outset.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to design and implement the Build_DeploymentSystem (BDS) for Project Odyssey. This system is foundational for efficient development, testing, and distribution.

1.  **Build Automation:**
    * Select and configure a build system (e.g., CMake, Meson, SCons, or language-specific tools like Cargo for Rust).
    * Create build scripts to compile source code, link libraries, and generate executables for target platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
    * Support different build configurations (Debug, Release, Profile).
2.  **Version Control Integration:**
    * Establish best practices for Git usage (branching model, commit messages, tagging releases).
    * Integrate build numbers or commit hashes into builds for easy identification.
3.  **Dependency Management:**
    * Implement a strategy for managing third-party libraries and dependencies (e.g., submodules, package managers like Conan/vcpkg for C++, Crates.io for Rust).
4.  **Asset Processing Integration:**
    * Integrate asset processing steps into the build pipeline if required (e.g., texture compression, model conversion) before packaging.
5.  **Packaging:**
    * Develop scripts to package the application binaries, assets, and necessary runtime libraries into distributable formats (e.g., ZIP archives, installers like Inno Setup/NSIS for Windows, DEB/RPM for Linux, DMG for macOS).
6.  **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    * Set up a CI server (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
    * Configure CI pipelines to automatically build and run unit/integration tests on every commit or pull request.
7.  **Continuous Deployment (CD) (Advanced):**
    * (Optional) Extend CI pipelines to automatically deploy successful builds to testing environments or create release candidates.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Build System:** CMake (cross-platform C++), Meson, Cargo (Rust), etc.
* **Scripting Languages:** Python, Bash, PowerShell for automation scripts.
* **Version Control:** Git.
* **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI.
* **Packaging Tools:** Inno Setup, NSIS, cpack (from CMake), platform-specific tools.
* **Dependency Managers:** Conan, vcpkg, Cargo, etc.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Manages:** The entire codebase, external dependencies, and project assets from a build perspective.
* **Produces:** Executable application, packaged installers/archives, test reports.
* **Interacts With:** Version control system (Git), CI/CD servers.
* **Used By:** Developers for local builds, QA for testing builds, and potentially end-users for installing the application.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Build Verification Tests:**
    * Ensure the build system successfully compiles and links the project on all target platforms and configurations.
    * Verify that all dependencies are correctly resolved and included.
* **Packaging Tests:**
    * Test that installers/archives are created correctly and contain all necessary files.
    * Verify that the application can be installed and run from the packaged distribution.
* **CI Pipeline Tests:**
    * Ensure CI pipelines trigger correctly, run tests, and report results accurately.
* **Cross-Platform Testing:**
    * Regularly test builds and packaged versions on all supported operating systems.

## 6. Documentation

* Comprehensive guide on how to set up the development environment and build the project from source.
* Documentation of the build system configuration and common build tasks.
* Instructions for packaging the application and creating releases.
* Details on the CI/CD pipeline setup and workflow.
* Branching strategy and versioning guidelines.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Robustness:** A reliable build and deployment system is key to consistent development and releases.
* **Maintainability:** Automation reduces manual effort and errors, making the process easier to manage.
* **Scalability:** Supports growing codebase, more developers, and multiple platforms.
* **Developer Productivity:** Automating builds, tests, and deployments frees up developer time.
