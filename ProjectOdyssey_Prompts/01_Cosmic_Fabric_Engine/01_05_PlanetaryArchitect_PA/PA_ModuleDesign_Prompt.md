# Prompt for Implementing: PlanetaryArchitect (PA)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** I. The Cosmic Fabric Engine
**Module:** 5. `PlanetaryArchitect (PA)`

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Input:** `UniverseGenesisSeed (UGS)` + planet/moon seed data from `StellarNursery (SN)`, local stellar environment (radiation, tides).
* **Process:** Generates detailed physical and chemical properties for planets and moons:
    * Calculates radius, mass, density, and internal structure (core, mantle, crust differentiation based on composition and thermal history).
    * Models atmospheric formation and composition (primary, secondary atmospheres), pressure, and temperature profile using energy balance equations.
    * Generates surface terrain using procedural techniques (fractal noise, hydraulic/thermal erosion simulations, tectonic/volcanic feature generation).
    * Distributes biomes and potential for life (if applicable) based on predefined rules or habitability models.
    * Parameterizes volcanism, tectonics, and magnetic field generation.
* **Output:** Detailed planet/moon object definitions with physical, geological, and atmospheric data.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar I):** The Universe is too vast to store explicitly. It must be generated and accessed dynamically based on observer context, combining known data with scientifically plausible procedural generation.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the `PlanetaryArchitect (PA)` module for Project Odyssey. This module takes the basic planetary and moon seeds from the `StellarNursery (SN)` and fleshes them out into fully detailed celestial bodies.

1.  **Planetary Seed Interpretation:**
    * Process input from SN: planet/moon type, approximate mass/radius, orbital elements, stellar environment (host star type, luminosity, age), UGS-derived seed for this specific body.
2.  **Internal Structure Modeling:**
    * Based on initial mass, type, and UGS-derived seed, model the differentiated internal structure:
        * Core (size, composition - e.g., iron/nickel, silicate, icy).
        * Mantle (composition, state - e.g., molten, solid, convective).
        * Crust (thickness, composition).
    * Calculate overall density and refine mass/radius.
    * Model internal heat sources (radiogenic decay, primordial heat) and their evolution, which influences geological activity and potential for a magnetic field.
3.  **Atmospheric Modeling:**
    * Determine presence, composition, and density of atmosphere based on planet mass, temperature (from stellar insolation and internal heat), surface gravity, and type (e.g., primary H/He envelope for gas giants, secondary outgassed/delivered atmosphere for terrestrials).
    * Model basic atmospheric layers (e.g., troposphere, stratosphere) and vertical temperature/pressure profiles.
    * Consider atmospheric loss mechanisms over time (simplified model).
    * Output parameters for `QuantumLeap Renderer` (e.g., scattering coefficients, color, cloud deck altitude).
4.  **Surface Terrain Generation (Procedural):**
    * **Heightmap Generation:** Utilize GPU-accelerated procedural techniques (e.g., multi-layered fractal noise like Perlin, Simplex, Worley; domain warping) to generate a base heightmap for the planetary surface. Resolution should be sufficient for detailed close-ups.
    * **Geological Features:**
        * **Tectonics (Simplified):** Model plate tectonics (if applicable, e.g., Earth-like planets) leading to mountain ranges, rift valleys, continents. For non-plate tectonic bodies, model other stress features.
        * **Volcanism:** Place volcanoes (shield, stratovolcanoes, cryovolcanoes) based on internal heat and tectonic context. Model lava plains, calderas.
        * **Impact Cratering:** Distribute impact craters of various sizes based on surface age and a plausible impactor flux history.
        * **Erosion (Simplified):** Apply simplified hydraulic (rivers, canyons, deltas if liquid present) and aeolian (dunes, wind-sculpted features) erosion models to the heightmap.
    * **Surface Texturing & Material Properties:** Define parameters for procedural texturing (albedo, roughness, metallicness) based on geology, biome, and atmospheric conditions.
5.  **Hydrosphere & Cryosphere Modeling (if applicable):**
    * Determine presence and distribution of liquids (water, methane, etc.) based on temperature, pressure, and available volatiles: oceans, lakes, rivers.
    * Model ice caps, glaciers, subsurface oceans.
6.  **Biome & Habitability Modeling (Parameterized):**
    * Based on temperature, atmosphere, presence of liquid water, and potentially other factors (e.g., stellar radiation, magnetic field presence), classify regions into biomes (e.g., desert, forest, tundra, ocean).
    * If life is to be procedurally generated (a very advanced feature), seed potential for simple or complex life based on habitability metrics. This module primarily sets the stage.
7.  **Magnetic Field Generation (Parameterized):**
    * Based on core properties (size, composition, convection) and rotation rate, determine the likelihood and approximate strength of a global magnetic field. This impacts atmospheric retention and surface radiation levels.
8.  **Output Detailed Planet/Moon Definition:**
    * Produce a rich data structure containing all generated details: internal structure, atmospheric profile, terrain heightmap parameters/seeds, surface feature descriptions, hydrosphere/cryosphere data, biome map parameters, magnetic field strength, etc.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust.
* **GPU Acceleration:** Essential for procedural terrain generation and potentially for some atmospheric/texturing processes. Utilize Vulkan Compute Shaders, CUDA, or OpenCL.
* **Libraries (Potential):** Noise generation libraries (FastNoiseLite, libnoise), libraries for handling large datasets if heightmaps are temporarily stored.
* **Algorithms:** Fractal noise algorithms, erosion simulation algorithms (simplified), cratering distribution models.
* **Performance:** Planet detailing can be intensive. Generation may need to occur progressively as the player approaches (LOD for planetary detail itself) or be done in stages. Generated data (like heightmaps) needs efficient storage/streaming.
* **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    * Define how to handle inconsistent inputs from SN or scenarios where plausible parameters cannot be generated (e.g., an ice giant too close to its star).
    * Log errors and potentially use fallback "average" planetary types if generation fails.
* **Logging:**
    * Log key generation steps for a planet (e.g., "Generating terrain for Planet X", "Atmosphere model applied", "Internal structure calculated").
    * Log any significant deviations or errors during the generation process.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * Ensure procedural generation algorithms do not have runaway conditions that could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU/GPU/memory). Validate input parameters from SN.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input:**
    * `UniverseGenesisSeed (UGS)` (or derived seed for the specific planet/moon).
    * `StellarNursery (SN)`: For basic planet/moon seed data (type, mass, orbit, stellar environment).
    * Configuration System: For parameters controlling detail levels, algorithm choices in procedural generation.
* **Output (consumed by):**
    * `CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)`: Stores the detailed planet/moon definitions.
    * `QuantumLeap Renderer`: Uses the detailed data (heightmaps, atmospheric parameters, surface texture seeds/parameters, biome maps) for rendering the planet/moon.
    * `AstroDynamicsEngine (PAD)`: May use some detailed atmospheric/surface data to refine its own parameterized models.
    * `Explorer's Interface`: For displaying detailed information about planets/moons when scanned or visited.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test individual procedural generation components (e.g., noise functions, erosion filters, crater placement).
    * Verify internal structure calculations against known planetary models.
    * Test atmospheric model outputs for a range of inputs.
    * Ensure deterministic output for the same input seed and parameters.
* **Statistical Validation:**
    * Generate a large population of planets of a certain type (e.g., Earth-like) and verify that their statistical distributions of properties (e.g., atmospheric pressure ranges, typical geological features) are plausible and diverse.
* **Visual Inspection:**
    * This is critical. Render generated planets/moons using the `QuantumLeap Renderer` to visually assess the quality, realism, and diversity of terrains, atmospheres, and surface features. Use debug views to inspect heightmaps, biome maps, etc.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Verify that `QuantumLeap Renderer` can correctly interpret and render all data provided by PA.
    * Ensure planets fit coherently within the star systems generated by SN.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the algorithms and models used for internal structure, atmosphere, terrain, hydrosphere, etc.
* Detail the parameters controlling each procedural generation step.
* Specify the output data structure for a fully detailed planet/moon.
* Provide guidance on how to create new planetary archetypes or tune generation for specific visual or scientific goals.
* Document error codes and fallback behaviors.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Hierarchical & Scalable Universe:** PA adds the finest level of detail to celestial bodies within star systems.
* **Evolving Matter & Energy:** While PA primarily defines initial states, inputs like internal heat and atmospheric loss imply evolution. Terrain shows history (craters, erosion).
* **Finite Computation:** Heavy reliance on procedural generation to create immense detail without storing it all. LOD for generation will be key.
* **Scientific Grounding:** Planetary formation, geology, and atmospheric science principles should guide the procedural algorithms.
