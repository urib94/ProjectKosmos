# Prompt for Implementing: CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** I. The Cosmic Fabric Engine
**Module:** 7. CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Storage:** A highly optimized, in-memory (with on-disk persistence/cache) adaptive spatial data structure. Likely a hierarchy of nested structures (e.g., universe-scale Octree containing galaxy-scale Octrees, which in turn contain star-system scale Octrees, down to planet-surface Quadtrees).
* **Function:**
    * Stores the dynamic state of all instantiated objects (both catalog-based and procedurally generated as the user explores).
    * Manages dynamic loading ("paging in") and unloading ("paging out") of regions and objects based on observer proximity, viewing frustum, and Level of Detail (LOD) requirements.
    * Stores object properties (physical, orbital, evolutionary), relationships (parent-child, e.g., moon orbiting planet), and pointers to relevant assets.
* **Optimization:** Designed for extremely fast spatial queries ("what's near me?", "what's in this volume?").
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar I):** The Universe is too vast to store explicitly. It must be generated and accessed dynamically based on observer context, combining known data with scientifically plausible procedural generation.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the CosmicObjectDatabase (COD) module for Project Odyssey. This module is responsible for storing and managing all instantiated cosmic objects efficiently.

1.  **Spatial Data Structure:**
    * Implement a hierarchical spatial data structure (e.g., nested Octrees/Quadtrees) for efficient storage and querying.
    * Support both in-memory and on-disk persistence/caching.
2.  **Object State Management:**
    * Store dynamic state for all objects (catalog-based and procedural).
    * Manage loading/unloading of objects based on observer context and LOD.
3.  **Property & Relationship Storage:**
    * Store physical, orbital, and evolutionary properties for each object.
    * Track parent-child relationships (e.g., planet-moon, star-planet).
    * Store pointers to relevant assets (models, textures, data).
4.  **Query & Retrieval:**
    * Provide fast spatial queries (e.g., objects within a volume, nearest neighbors).
    * Support queries by object type, state, or relationship.
5.  **Scalability & Performance:**
    * Optimize for large numbers of objects and real-time access.
    * Support multi-threaded access and updates.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust (Adhere to overall project choice).
* **Data Structures:** Hierarchical spatial structures (Octree, Quadtree, etc.).
* **Algorithmic Choices:**
    * Efficient paging, caching, and LOD management.
    * Thread-safe access and updates.
* **Configuration:**
    * Allow for tuning of cache sizes, LOD thresholds, and persistence options.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input:**
    * Instantiated objects from procedural and catalog modules.
* **Output (consumed by):**
    * All modules requiring object state (physics, rendering, AI, etc.).
    * QuantumLeap Renderer: For visual representation.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Verify correct storage, retrieval, and querying of objects.
    * Test paging and LOD management.
* **Performance Tests:**
    * Benchmark spatial queries and loading/unloading operations.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Ensure compatibility with all consuming modules.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the spatial data structure and object management process.
* Specify the format and structure of stored object data.
* Provide guidance for tuning performance and extending functionality.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Hierarchical & Scalable Universe:** COD enables efficient management of vast numbers of objects.
* **Finite Computation:** Only stores and manages objects as needed.
* **Performance:** Optimized for real-time access and queries.
* **Modularity:** Provide a clean, well-documented API for integration with other modules.
