# Prompt for Implementing: PhysicsCulling_LOD_System (PCLS)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** II. The AstroDynamics Engine
**Module:** 6. `PhysicsCulling_LOD_System (PCLS)`

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Function:** Manages the "physics bubble." High-fidelity physics (e.g., N-body for all planets in a system) only runs for objects near the player/observer or explicitly focused. Distant systems use pre-calculated or simplified Keplerian orbits, or even static positions until approached. Switches physics models based on object type, scale, and observer interest.
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar II):** Physical laws are universal but manifest differently at various scales and energies. A modular, multi-scale, and computationally efficient approach to physics is required. (PCLS implements the "computationally efficient" aspect for physics).

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the `PhysicsCulling_LOD_System (PCLS)` module for Project Odyssey. This module is critical for managing computational resources by dynamically adjusting the scope and fidelity of physics simulations based on observer proximity, focus, and system capabilities.

1.  **Physics Interest Management:**
    * Identify the primary "point(s) of interest" for physics simulation. This is typically centered around the player/observer's location and their explicit focus target.
    * Define different zones or "bubbles" of physics fidelity radiating from these points of interest (e.g., High-Fidelity Zone, Medium-Fidelity Zone, Low-Fidelity/Culled Zone).
2.  **Physics LOD Levels Definition:**
    * For different types of physics simulations (e.g., N-body orbital mechanics, stellar evolution updates, atmospheric dynamics), define multiple Levels of Detail (LODs):
        * **High LOD:** Full simulation (e.g., all bodies in an N-body system, frequent stellar evolution updates).
        * **Medium LOD:** Simplified simulation (e.g., Keplerian orbits for distant planets in a system, less frequent stellar updates, basic PPD evolution).
        * **Low LOD:** Cached/Analytic state (e.g., planets follow pre-calculated ephemeris paths, stars only update very slowly if at all, PPDs static).
        * **Culled/Inactive:** No active physics simulation; objects are static or follow a very basic trajectory until they enter a higher LOD zone.
3.  **Dynamic LOD Assignment:**
    * Continuously monitor observer position, focus target, and potentially system performance.
    * Assign the appropriate physics LOD to celestial objects or entire systems (e.g., star systems, galaxies) based on their distance from the point(s) of interest and predefined LOD transition thresholds.
    * Implement smooth transitions between LODs to avoid jarring physical changes (e.g., when a system switches from Keplerian orbits to full N-body). This might involve matching states or short interpolation periods.
4.  **Physics Module Orchestration:**
    * The PCLS doesn't run physics itself but instructs other physics modules (`NBodyGravitationalOrchestrator (NGO)`, `StellarEvolutionEngine (SEE)`, `PlanetaryAtmosphericDynamics (PAD)`, etc.) on which objects to simulate and at what fidelity level.
    * Provide an API for physics modules to register themselves and their supported LODs with PCLS.
    * PCLS calls update/activation/deactivation/LOD_change methods on the relevant physics modules.
5.  **Performance-Driven Adaptation (Optional - Advanced):**
    * If overall system performance (e.g., frame rate) drops below a target, PCLS could dynamically reduce physics LODs for less critical objects/systems to conserve resources.
6.  **Configuration:**
    * LOD distance thresholds, physics update frequencies per LOD, and specific models used for each LOD should be configurable.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust.
* **Data Structures:** Spatial query structures (e.g., Octree, k-d tree, inherited from or shared with `CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)`) to efficiently determine object proximity to points of interest. Lists or maps to track objects and their current physics LOD state.
* **Algorithms:** Distance calculations, logic for LOD state transitions, potentially heuristics for performance-driven adaptation.
* **Performance Considerations:**
    * PCLS itself must be lightweight and efficient, as it runs frequently to update LOD assignments.
    * Spatial queries should be optimized.
* **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    * Handle cases where physics modules fail to switch LODs or report errors.
    * Ensure graceful degradation if PCLS cannot maintain target performance even at lowest LODs (log warnings).
* **Logging:**
    * Log significant LOD changes for major systems (e.g., "Star System X transitioned to High-Fidelity N-body").
    * Log when physics is culled or activated for specific objects/regions.
    * Log performance metrics if adaptive LOD based on performance is implemented.

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input (receives data from/is controlled by):**
    * `CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)`: For spatial information about all objects to determine their proximity.
    * `Explorer's Interface (UCVC, OITS)`: For player/observer position and current focus target.
    * `Continuum Core (Performance Monitor)`: If implementing performance-driven adaptation.
    * Configuration System: For LOD thresholds and physics model settings per LOD.
* **Interaction (controls/orchestrates):**
    * `NBodyGravitationalOrchestrator (NGO)`: Instructs which N-body systems to simulate and at what fidelity (e.g., full N-body vs. Keplerian).
    * `StellarEvolutionEngine (SEE)`: Controls update frequency or detail level of stellar evolution calculations.
    * `PlanetaryAtmosphericDynamics (PAD)`: Controls update frequency or detail of atmospheric effects.
    * Other physics-related modules that support LODs.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test LOD assignment logic: verify objects are assigned correct LODs based on distance rules.
    * Test smooth transition logic (if applicable, e.g., state matching during N-body to Keplerian switch).
* **Scenario Tests:**
    * Create scenarios where the observer moves rapidly through different regions (e.g., approaching a star system from deep space). Verify:
        * Physics LODs change appropriately for systems/objects coming into/leaving the "physics bubble."
        * No jarring visual or physical discontinuities occur during LOD transitions.
        * Physics computations are indeed reduced for distant/culled objects.
* **Performance Profiling:**
    * Measure the actual reduction in CPU load when PCLS culls physics or reduces LODs for distant objects.
    * Profile PCLS itself to ensure it's not a bottleneck.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Verify that physics modules (`NGO`, `SEE`, `PAD`) correctly respond to commands from PCLS (activate, deactivate, change LOD).
    * Ensure that data flow between PCLS and `CosmicObjectDatabase` (for object locations) and `Explorer's Interface` (for observer location) is correct.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the defined physics LOD levels for each relevant physics module.
* Detail the rules and thresholds for LOD transitions.
* Explain the "physics bubble" concept and how it's managed.
* Provide comprehensive documentation for PCLS's API, especially how physics modules should register and interact with it.
* Document configurable parameters (LOD distances, update frequencies).
* Explain any strategies used for smooth LOD transitions or performance-driven adaptation.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Finite Computation:** This module is the primary enabler for managing finite computational resources in the face of a potentially infinite number of physically interacting objects. It's essential for performance.
* **Hierarchical & Scalable Universe:** PCLS applies LOD principles hierarchically (e.g., a whole distant galaxy might have its internal dynamics entirely culled).
* **Active Observation:** The observer's position and focus directly drive the physics LOD decisions, making their experience central to resource allocation.
* **Modularity:** PCLS acts as an orchestrator, decoupled from the specific implementations of the physics modules themselves.
