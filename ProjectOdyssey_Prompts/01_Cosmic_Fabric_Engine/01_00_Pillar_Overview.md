**Context:** You are an LLM agent assisting in the design of "Project Odyssey." This prompt concerns the **Pillar I: The Cosmic Fabric Engine**. This pillar is responsible for the universe's representation and state.

**Architectural Blueprint Excerpt for Pillar I:**
* **Purpose:** To define, generate, store, and manage the state of the entire universe, its objects, and their properties over time.
* **First Principle Applied:** The Universe is too vast to store explicitly. It must be generated and accessed dynamically based on observer context, combining known data with scientifically plausible procedural generation.
* **Key Modules within this Pillar:**
    1.  UniverseGenesisSeed (UGS)
    2.  CosmologicalModeler (CM)
    3.  GalacticForge (GF)
    4.  StellarNursery (SN)
    5.  PlanetaryArchitect (PA)
    6.  CatalogIntegrator (CI)
    7.  CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)
    8.  TemporalIndexer (TI)

**Task:** Write a concise overview for the **Pillar I: The Cosmic Fabric Engine**.

**Instructions:**
1.  Reiterate the **Purpose** of this pillar.
2.  Briefly restate the **First Principle Applied** to this pillar.
3.  Conclude by stating that this pillar achieves its purpose through a series of interconnected modules (you don't need to list them again here, as they will be detailed individually).

**Output Format:** A short paragraph (3-5 sentences) summarizing the Cosmic Fabric Engine pillar.
