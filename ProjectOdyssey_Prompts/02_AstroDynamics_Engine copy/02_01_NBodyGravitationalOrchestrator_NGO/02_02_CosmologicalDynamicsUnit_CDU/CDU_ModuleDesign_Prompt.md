# Prompt for Implementing: CosmologicalDynamicsUnit (CDU)

**Project:** Project Odyssey
**Pillar:** II. The AstroDynamics Engine
**Module:** 2. `CosmologicalDynamicsUnit (CDU)`

## 1. Module Overview

**As per the Project Odyssey Architectural Blueprint:**

* **Scope:** Inter-galactic scales; the expansion of the universe.
* **Process:** Implements Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric to model the homogeneous and isotropic expansion of the universe based on parameters from `CosmologicalModeler (CM)`. Calculates redshift due to expansion. Affects the proper distances and apparent positions of distant galaxies.
* **Note:** Does not apply *within* gravitationally bound systems (like galaxies or solar systems).
* **First Principle Applied (Pillar II):** Physical laws are universal but manifest differently at various scales and energies. A modular, multi-scale, and computationally efficient approach to physics is required.

## 2. Core Requirements & Functionality

You are to develop the `CosmologicalDynamicsUnit (CDU)` module for Project Odyssey. This module is responsible for modeling the expansion of the universe and its effects on observations of distant objects.

1.  **FLRW Metric Implementation:**
    * Implement functions to calculate key cosmological distances based on the FLRW metric and input cosmological parameters (H₀, Ω\_m, Ω\_Λ, Ω\_r from `CosmologicalModeler` or a central configuration):
        * Comoving distance.
        * Luminosity distance.
        * Angular diameter distance.
        * Lookback time.
    * These functions will take redshift (z) as input or allow solving for z given a distance/time.
2.  **Scale Factor (a) Evolution:**
    * Implement the evolution of the scale factor `a(t)` as a function of simulation time `t_sim`, based on the Friedmann equations and the energy density components (matter, radiation, dark energy).
3.  **Cosmological Redshift Calculation:**
    * Provide functions to calculate the cosmological redshift `z` for objects based on their comoving distance or the scale factor at the time of light emission.
    * Conversely, calculate the emission scale factor/time given an observed redshift.
4.  **Coordinate Transformation:**
    * Provide utilities to transform between comoving coordinates (used for large-scale structure that expands with the universe) and proper coordinates (physical distances at a given epoch `t_sim`).
    * This is crucial for correctly positioning distant galaxies whose cataloged or procedurally generated positions might be in comoving space.
5.  **Exclusion for Bound Systems:**
    * Clearly define the logic or criteria for *not* applying cosmological expansion effects within gravitationally bound systems (e.g., within the virial radius of a galaxy or galaxy cluster). The expansion applies to the space *between* these bound structures.

## 3. Technical Stack & Implementation Details

* **Primary Language:** C++ or Rust.
* **Libraries (Potential):** Numerical integration libraries (e.g., GSL, or own implementation of Runge-Kutta) for solving Friedmann equations if not using analytical solutions for simplified cases.
* **Numerical Precision:** Use `double` precision for cosmological calculations, especially for distances and time, to maintain accuracy over vast scales.
* **Performance Considerations:**
    * Distance and redshift calculations will be called frequently, especially by the renderer for distant objects. Optimize these functions.
    * Consider pre-calculating or creating lookup tables for distance measures as a function of redshift for a given cosmology if performance is critical, though direct calculation is often feasible.
* **Error Handling & Resilience:**
    * Handle edge cases in cosmological calculations (e.g., z=0, very high z).
    * Validate input cosmological parameters.
* **Logging:**
    * Log the active cosmological parameter set at startup.
    * Log any significant errors during calculations (e.g., numerical integration failures).

## 4. Integration Points

* **Input (receives data from/is controlled by):**
    * `CosmologicalModeler (CM)` or Configuration System: For the set of cosmological parameters (H₀, Ω\_m, Ω\_Λ, Ω\_r).
    * `TemporalIndexer (TI)`: For the current simulation time `t_sim` to determine the current scale factor `a(t_sim)`.
* **Output (provides data/services to):**
    * `QuantumLeap Renderer (specifically CBR and galaxy rendering)`: To correctly calculate positions, apparent sizes, and brightness of distant galaxies, and to apply cosmological redshift to their light.
    * `CosmicObjectDatabase (COD)`: For converting stored comoving coordinates of distant galaxies to proper coordinates for rendering or physics interaction (if any physics applies at that scale).
    * `Explorer's Interface (Starmaps)`: To display distances and redshifts correctly.
    * `Warp_HyperspaceNavigation (WHN)`: For calculating travel times and energy requirements for intergalactic jumps, considering expansion.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Verify distance measure calculations (comoving, luminosity, angular diameter, lookback time) against known analytical solutions for simplified cosmologies (e.g., matter-only, Lambda-only) or against established online cosmological calculators for standard ΛCDM parameters.
    * Test scale factor evolution `a(t)`.
    * Verify redshift calculations.
    * Test coordinate transformations between comoving and proper frames.
* **Consistency Checks:**
    * Ensure that `1+z = a(t_observe) / a(t_emit)` relationship holds.
    * Verify that different distance measures are self-consistent.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Place a test galaxy at a known comoving distance. Verify its apparent position, size, and redshift as rendered by `QuantumLeap Renderer` are correct according to CDU calculations for the current `t_sim`.
    * Test with `TemporalIndexer (TI)`: change `t_sim` and verify that the apparent properties of distant objects change correctly due to the evolving scale factor.

## 6. Documentation

* Document the specific cosmological equations and solutions implemented (e.g., for Friedmann equations, distance measures).
* Clearly define all cosmological parameters used and their units.
* Provide comprehensive documentation for the CDU's public API (functions for calculating distances, redshift, scale factor, coordinate transforms).
* Explain how the exclusion for bound systems is handled.
* Detail any assumptions or simplifications made in the cosmological model.

## 7. Adherence to Project Principles

* **Gravity-Dominated Structure (at large scales):** CDU models the overall expansion driven by the universe's total energy density, which is shaped by gravity and dark energy.
* **Finite Speed of Light:** Lookback time and redshift are direct consequences of the finite speed of light in an expanding universe.
* **Evolving Matter & Energy:** The expansion rate itself evolves based on the changing dominance of radiation, matter, and dark energy over cosmic time.
* **Scientific Grounding:** Implementation must be based on the standard ΛCDM cosmological model or other well-established cosmological theories.
